Email Spam Classification Model

Overview
This project is an Email Spam Classification system that uses machine learning techniques to identify whether an email is spam or not spam. The model is built using the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm and is based on textual features extracted from email data. Extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) has been performed to clean and understand the dataset before model building.

Project Motivation
The primary objective of this project is to create an efficient and accurate model to automatically classify incoming emails as spam or not spam based on the text content. Given the increasing volume of unwanted spam emails, such models are crucial in ensuring better email filtering and improving user experience.

Technologies Used
Python
Pandas for data manipulation
Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
Scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms
Multinomial Naive Bayes for text classification
Natural Language Processing (NLP) for text preprocessing
Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains emails labeled as spam or not spam. The features of the dataset include:

Email text: The content of the email.
Label: Binary indicator where 1 is spam and 0 is not spam.
Data Source
The dataset was obtained from [Kaggle/UCI Machine Learning Repository/Custom source]. (Modify this according to your dataset source)
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Before model building, EDA was performed to clean and understand the dataset. Key steps include:

Missing data handling: Checked for any null or missing values.
Data balance check: The distribution of spam vs. not spam emails was visualized.
Text preprocessing: Applied tokenization, removal of stopwords, lemmatization, and vectorization using TF-IDF or CountVectorizer.
Word clouds: Visualized common words in spam and non-spam emails.
Frequency distribution: Analyzed the most frequent words in the email body.
Visualization
Some key visualizations include:

Bar plots: Distribution of spam and non-spam emails.
Word cloud: For common words in spam and non-spam emails.
Histograms: Distribution of word counts across emails.
Model Building
The core model used is Multinomial Naive Bayes, which is particularly well-suited for text classification tasks. The steps involved:

Text vectorization: Emails were converted to numerical form using TF-IDF or Count Vectorizer.
Model training: The model was trained on the processed dataset.
Hyperparameter tuning: GridSearchCV was used to fine-tune parameters like alpha.
Libraries Used
scikit-learn: For building and evaluating the model.
nltk: For natural language processing tasks.
Evaluation Metrics
The model was evaluated using various performance metrics:

Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1 Score
Confusion Matrix
These metrics were used to measure how well the model performed on the test set, especially considering the imbalanced nature of the dataset.
